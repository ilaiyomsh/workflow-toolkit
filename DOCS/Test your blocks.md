Try using your blocks in demo workflows.

You can test your blocks in your monday account before releasing them to end-users.

1. Open your app in the Developer Center.
2. Under Manage, select **App versions**.
3. Click **Gradual release** to create a new release.
4. Select the version you want to release, and then choose the blocks and fields you want to test.
5. Add your account ID to the *Accounts*. section at the bottom of the page. This will release the draft to your account only.
6. Click **Release** at the top right of the page. Your blocks will now be available to test in the workflow builder.
